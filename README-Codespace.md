# Applied AI Engineering for the Enterprise - Day 2

## Models & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to do the labs. 

<br><br>

**1. Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 suggested).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

**2. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skilldevai/ae-day2?quickstart=1)

<br><br>

**3. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

![Creating new codespace from button](./images/aia-0-2.png?raw=true "Creating new codespace from button")

This will run for a long time (up to 10 minutes) while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

![Ready to use](./images/aia-1-1.png?raw=true "Ready to use")

When you see this, just hit *Enter* to get to a prompt.

<br><br>

**4. Get a HuggingFace API token.**

Lab 4 (and our capstone deployment when we get to that) need a free HuggingFace API token. Follow these steps.

A. Go to (https://huggingface.co)[https://huggingface.co] and log in if you already have an account. If you need to create an account, click the *Sign Up* button or visit (https://huggingface.co/join)[https://huggingface.co/join]

![HF login](./images/aia-3-19.png?raw=true "HF login")

<br>
   
B. Navigate to (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)[https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens].  Click on *+ Create new token*.

![Get token](./images/aia-3-20.png?raw=true "Get token")

<br>

C. Select **Write** for the token type and provide a name.

![Read token](./images/aia-3-21.png?raw=true "Read token")

<br>
   
D. Click on the *Create token* button and copy the token (it starts with `hf_`). Save it somewhere.

![Save/copy token](./images/aia-3-22.png?raw=true "Save/copy token")

<br>

E. For all runs of agents in the labs, make sure the token is set in your terminal before running the agent:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
```

<br>

F. Alternatively, to make this permanent for your codespace session, add it to your shell profile:

```bash
echo 'export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

<br><br>

**5. Open up the *labs.md* file so you can follow along with the labs.**
You can either open it in a separate browser instance or open it in the codespace.

<br>

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**
